SPLASH! Into the water Peter went!

It was ***roiling*** and boiling and full of sizzle and foam, surges, lifts, thrusts and undertows from the
powerful strokes of the Countess' propeller just beneath the surface. Also it was shockingly cold.

Peter felt himself caught in the grip of an irresistible ***whirlpool***; he was pulled down, rolled over, thrust
head over heels, then shot to the surface, and before he could ***gasp*** his lungs full of air, sucked down
again into the green depths. With his chest near to bursting from want of air, he fought and struggled to
rise, swimming with all four feet, and at last reached the surface sufficiently far behind in the wake of
the ship to be no longer subject to the forces stirred up by her machinery. The whirlpool died away, the
***choking white foam*** vanished, and he was swimming at last on top of the chill, salt, green and glassy sea.

Off in the distance, perhaps fifty or sixty yards away, he saw a tiny pinpoint of an object moving in the
water and tried to call out `Jennie! Don't be afraid! Hold out. It's me, Peter. I'm coming' but succeeded
in getting only a mouthful of salt water which tasted horrible, and thereafter he decided to keep his
mouth closed and concentrate on reaching her side. But he thought he heard a faint answering cry from
her, and finding that he had no difficulty in staying up now and holding his head out of the water by
lifting his ***chin***, he swam as rapidly as his four legs would take him in her direction.

What would happen when he reached her, he did not know, or at least he was not minded to think
about, since it was certain that the sailor was quite right and the last thing Captain Sourlies would do
was put the Countess about and stop her, losing precious time for no better purpose than to ***snatch*** two
***vagrant*** cats, who were aboard quite uninvited, at that, from a watery grave. But at least, whatever
happened, they would try together, he and the kind and gentle little cat who had first saved his life and
then been so devoted to him. They would be together to swim to the mainland that ***glittered*** so green
and enticing in the distance, and if they could not reach it—well, then, at least they could comfort one
another in their last moments and would not be separated.

Now Peter had halved the distance between Jennie and himself and to his ***dismay*** saw that she was
barely making headway in his direction. Her little head, with the ears thrown back, sleek and wet, was
hardly borne above the surface, and she was swimming but weakly. Even then he heard her call to him,
though it was barely audible—Peter, go back! You shouldn't have come. I can't hold out any longer.
Good-bye, Peter dear--'

And with that, her head vanished beneath the water. It reappeared once more, and now Peter was close
enough to see the despairing look in her eyes before she went down again she was gone. He redoubled
his efforts, making his paws fairly foam through the water while his breastbone parted the sea in the
shape of an arrow or an inverted `V' on either side of him, in a frantic effort to reach her in time, but
now he could no longer see her or where she had been. Indeed, he ***would have lost her for ever, had not just at that moment the tip of her tail appeared*** above the surface like a buoy marking the spot. The next instant, more human than cat, he dived beneath the water, his eyes wide open, settled his teeth gently
in Jennie's skin at the back of her neck, and quickly pulled himself and her with him back to the surface
again.

By swimming slowly now, that is, just moving his feet, he was able to keep his head as well as hers above
water, limp and apparently senseless as she was, but he knew that there was no longer any question of
their reaching the mainland a good two or three miles away. Indeed, the immediate question was how
long would his own strength hold out to enable him to keep them on top of the sea. For he just now
realized that he had been severely strained by his fight with the giant rat, while the thumping and
battering he had taken against the sides of the cases had bruised him and further drained his strength.
For the first time he began to have serious doubts as to whether they could manage to save themselves,
and he had a ***treacherous*** moment given over to wondering whether it would not be easier to give up
and, side by side with Jennie Baldrin, to sink for ever beneath the waves, or whether it was worth the
struggle to keep on swimming and trying to test out the old adage that while there was life there was
yet hope.

Up to that moment, Peter had not even looked after the Countess of Greenock, for the sight of the ship
diminishing in the distance and cruelly abandoning them to their fate would have been too painful to be
endured, but now with the knowledge that it was only a matter of minutes before his own strength,
taxed by the added difficulty of holding up Jennie, must give out, he began to swim in a small circle and
permitted himself one despairing look to see just how far away it was she had sailed since he had leaped
from her deck into the sea.

To his ***utter surprise and joy*** he saw her floating, stock still and motionless except for the black column
of smoke pouring straight skyward from her funnel, not more than a hundred yards away. Turned
broadside, her ***hull*** rising like a wall from the smooth surface of the water, she looked larger than
pictures he had seen of the Queen Mary, and twice as handsome. And what was ten times more
beautiful was the sight of the lifeboat manned by eight straining sailors, commanded by Angus the bos'n
and with Mr. Strachan ***perched*** in the bow, already halfway between the rusted sides of the Countess
and himself and Jennie. True, as a display of oarsmanship it was shocking, for no two of the blades
dipped, pulled, or emerged from the water in the same time; the lifeboat rocked alarmingly on the
dead-calm sea, threatening to ***pitch*** both Angus and Mr. Strachan over the side at any moment, and it
resembled nothing so much as an ***inebriated porcupine trying to stagger*** along the roof of a glasshouse
conservatory. Nevertheless, it was making definite headway and giving a convincing demonstration that
the miracle had happened. The Countess of Greenock had gone about, circled and stopped, put forth a
boat, and they were about to be rescued.

A few moments later, urged on by the shouts of Angus and the directions given by Mr. Strachan from
the bow, the lifeboat drew alongside. Mr. Strachan was armed with a long pole, to the end of which was
attached a dip-net. Leaning over the side, he thrust it through the water beneath Peter and Jennie, and
with a triumphant cry of 'Hah! Got 'em!' swept them both out of the sea and into the bottom of the
lifeboat, where Peter moved feebly, trying to disentangle his paws from the mesh of the net and feeling
like crying from ***sheer*** relief and ***gratitude***, and Jennie Baldrin moved not at all.
